Accountable generates a separate key-encryption key {kek} from your given passphrase to use to encrypt your DEK. Accountable then encrypts the DEK and sends it to our servers to store.

If someone can give the server a passphrase hash that results in the correct mash, the server assumes that person is you, and happily sends over your encrypted data.
