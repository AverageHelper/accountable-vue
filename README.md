# Accountable

A Vue app for managing monetary assets. All data is encrypted client-side and stored on a server that you control.

> This project is undergoing rapid development and should be considered experimental. Use it at your own risk. ü§ô

### Alternative Projects

There are many open-source balance keepers out there, but none I've found that I quite like. A few are listed [here](https://opensource.com/life/17/10/personal-finance-tools-linux).

### The Goal

The aim of Accountable is to be cross-platform and portable. Eventually, I plan to have an Android client on the F-droid store, an iOS app on the App Store, and a website as well. The self-host option will always be available, and I intend for this project to always be open-source.

## Setup

### Prerequesites

This project requires Node 14 and NPM v7 or above. You can check what versions you have installed by running `npm -v` and `node -v`:

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
8.1.2
v16.13.1
```

### Installation

- Clone the repository
- Create a .env file at the root of the project, like the one shown below:

```sh
# .env

# Where your server lives
VITE_ACCOUNTABLE_SERVER_URL={your Accountable backend URL here}:40850

# Enable the "Login" menu item
VITE_ENABLE_LOGIN=true
```

> Note: If you're hosting the Accountable server on the same machine that hosts the Accountable client, do NOT use `localhost` for the `VITE_ACCOUNTABLE_SERVER_URL`. You must set this to a URL that _clients_‚Äîthat is, web browsers‚Äîcan use to access your Accountable backend.
>
> Using `localhost` for this will cause clients to try _themselves_ as the Accountable server, and that's usually not what you want.

#### Compile and Run the Client

```sh
$ cd accountable-vue          # Be in the root directory
$ npm ci                      # Install dependencies
$ npm run build:client:quick  # Compile the client
$ npm run dev:client          # Start a local webserver
```

> Note: The build script injects your .env values at build time. If you must change .env, remember to re-build the client.

The webserver will print a URL in your terminal to paste into your browser. It should look something like [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Give that a go, and you're off to the races!

I recommend you deploy the client (the contents of the `accountable-vue/dist` folder) on a webserver like [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/).

> Note: DO NOT FORGET your Accountable ACCOUNT ID or PASSWORD. If you do, your data is irretrievably lost. You have been warned. :)

#### Compile and Run the Server

```sh
$ cd server      # Be in the server's directory
$ npm ci         # Install dependencies
$ npm run build  # Compile the server
$ npm start      # Start the server in development mode
```

If you've set `VITE_ACCOUNTABLE_SERVER_URL` to a URL that can reach this server, then you should be good to go.

I recommend using something like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io) to run the server properly. (Instructions coming soon‚Ñ¢)
