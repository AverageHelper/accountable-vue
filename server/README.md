# Accountable Server

The machine that stores stuff.

> This project is undergoing rapid development and should be considered experimental. Use it at your own risk. ðŸ¤™

## API

This server doesn't do much on its own once you're authenticated. You give it data, and you ask for that data back. If you want to encrypt that data, do that yourself before you send it.

I'm working on setting up a frontend to document the API. The OpenAPI schema is found in [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml).

## Setup

### Prerequesites

This project requires Node 14 and NPM v7 or above. You can check what versions you have installed by running `npm -v` and `node -v`:

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
8.1.2
v16.13.1
```

### Installation

- Clone the repository
- Create a .env file at the root of the project, like the one shown below:

```sh
# .env

# Where your server lives
DB={your database folder location here}  # defaults to ./database/db
HOST={your frontend hostname, with protocol}  # ex: HOST=https://example.com
```

#### Compile and Run the Server

```sh
$ cd accountable-vue/server  # Be in the server's directory
$ npm ci                     # Install dependencies
$ npm run build              # Compile the server
$ node .                     # Start the server in development mode
```

I recommend using something like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io) to run the server properly. (Instructions coming soonâ„¢)
